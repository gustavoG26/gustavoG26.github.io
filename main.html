							<h1>About Me</h1>
						</header>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gustavog_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							My name is Gustavo Guijarro, and I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for technology including software engineering, web development, IT, and more.
							Growing up, I was always fascinated by how things are built and driven by a curiosity about the inner workings of technology, which led me to pursue a career in this field. 
							Through my academic and personal journey, I have worked on projects that have honed both my technical and leadership skills.
							For example, I led a team to develop a Chrome extension with auto-skip functionality on multiple streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube. This experience strengthened my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, while also improving my collaboration and project management skills.
						</p>
						<p> <span></span>
							Furthermore, I have worked on a car dealership simulation that applied various object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns. 
							This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of OOP concepts and practice implementing design patterns to create flexible, maintainable software. These experiences have sharpened my ability to build well-structured solutions and tackle challenges effectively.
						</p>
						<p><span></span>
							In addition to my project experience, I gained practical IT knowledge while working as an Information Technology Technician at CU OIT Buff Techs. 
							In this role, I provided technical assistance to students, staff, and faculty at CU Boulder by troubleshooting and resolving various software and hardware issues. 
							This experience has allowed me to apply my problem-solving skills in a real-world setting and further develop my technical expertise.
						</p>
						<p> <span></span>
							Currently, I am studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. This certification will strengthen my understanding of cloud architecture and services, allowing me to apply this knowledge to future projects and roles in cloud computing.
						</p>		
						<p><span></span>
							As I continue my professional journey, I am excited to apply my skills and experience to opportunities in software engineering or related roles in tech. 
							I am particularly interested in positions that allow me to grow both personally and professionally while contributing to innovative projects and further developing my technical skills.
